Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeast Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River, situated in the place that is now the country of Egypt. Ancient Egyptian civilization <br> followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3100 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes (often identified with Narmer).<br>

The history of ancient Egypt occurred as a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative stability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle <br> Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age, and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age.<br><br>
